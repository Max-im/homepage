                      &mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far.
                      Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person
                      ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me. Romney &mdash; I have a
                      Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ
                      is one of the highest &mdash; and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid
                      or insecure, it's not your fault.

                        Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no
                        grades, certificates and other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in
                        real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                        students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                        ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course.
                        I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                        2004 as the Trump Park Avenue. I sure do like my surname!

                        Trump Place. Me and the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and
                        that was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City

                        seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation,
                        the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building

                        Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, I had

                        Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million
                        to restore the building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I
                        called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)

                        I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private
                        club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another
                        annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also
                        opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                        she is another Trump!

                        I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's
                        play schedule and filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football
                        League, so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then they were great!

                        Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew
                        of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store,
                        including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul
                        Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                        interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the
                        same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park
                        and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000
                        less than the initial budget!
